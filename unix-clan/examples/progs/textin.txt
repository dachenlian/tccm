This is a sample text that I have created to illustrate the use of the 
TEXTIN program. As long as your input text has sentences that end in 
periods, question marks or exclamations, the program will know how 
to separate them.  However, if there are a lot of other marks, such 
as footnotes, or links to websites, it may get confused.  In that 
case you will need to do some reformatting.  If you find any things 
that you would like to have improved in TEXTIN, just send us a note 
and we will try to make the output a bit cleaner.  This program 
could be used, for example, to input student essays into CHAT format 
for further analysis through the CLAN programs, such as FREQ. 

Blank lines, such as the one above will be deleted.
